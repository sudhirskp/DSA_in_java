## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java. It is designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning or improving their understanding of DSA using Java.

## Features
- Implementation of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- Well-documented code for easy understanding and learning.
- Examples and test cases for each data structure and algorithm.

## Installation
To use the code from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sudhirskp/DSA_in_java.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DSA_in_java
    ```

3. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

## Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is located in its respective directory. To run a specific example or test case, navigate to the relevant directory and execute the Java files.

For example, to run a sorting algorithm:
1. Navigate to the `sorting` directory:
    ```sh
    cd src/sorting
    ```

2. Compile and run the Java file:
    ```sh
    javac QuickSort.java
    java QuickSort
    ```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new algorithms to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:
    ```sh
    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```

4. Push to the branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5. Open a pull request to the `master` branch.
